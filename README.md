# 💪An Expressjs API for Crossfit🚀:

I really like to use best practices for building api. I believe this practice helps other developers to understand the code better and make them comfortable to make any further changes. In this way the application can be extended easily😀.

#### Techonology used:

- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- Nodemon(dev. dependency)
- uuid(v4) for generating unique id
- body-perser(for persing data)
